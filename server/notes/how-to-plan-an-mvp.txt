How to Plan an MVP

  The thing that gets people screwed up with their MVP is that they have
  a vision that’s big, but they’re not willing to have an MVP that’s
  small

Notes from Michael Seibel’s talk as part of Y Combinator’s Startup
School 2019 Series.

Defining an MVP

An MVP is the first thing you can give to the very first group of people
you want to target, to see if you can deliver any value to them.

It is useful to talk to some users before building your MVP to better
understand the problem.

Goals of a pre-launch Startup:

-   Launch quickly
-   Get initial customers
-   Talk to customers and get feedback
-   Iterate. Improve the product.

It might turn out that the ‘full thing’ you want to build is not what
the customer wants at all.

Build a lean MVP:

-   Very fast to build (weeks not months)
-   Limited functionality
-   Appeal to a small set of users
-   A base to iterate from

Heavy MVP (few cases):

-   Significant regulations (insurance, banking, etc.)
-   Hardtech
-   Biotech
-   Moonshot

A launch is not special. To launch simply means to start getting
customers.

Hold the problem you want to solve tightly. Hold the customers tightly.
Hold the problem you’re building lightly.

Hacks for building an MVP quickly

-   Timebox your specs
-   Write your specs
-   Cut your spec
-   Dont’ fall in love with your MVP

You will recognize that you have product market fit once you spend your
time maintaining your app online instead of figuring out new features
and developing them.
