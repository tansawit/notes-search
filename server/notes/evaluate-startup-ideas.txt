A Common Misconception about Investors

A (good) investor’s job is not to figure out what’s wrong with the
company, but how it could possibly win.

Startup Ideas

Startups are defined as companies that grows quickly.

Thus a startup idea is a hypothesis about why a company could grow
quickly.

It this then the founder’s job to figure out how to construct that
hypothesis (pitch) so that investors can also understand why the
idea/company will grow quickly.

What constitute an idea?

1. Problem (What is the setting/initial problem that spurs this idea)

Good problems are:

-   Popular > Lots of people have this problem (1M+)
    -   Large market
-   Growing > More and more people are having this problem (20%/year)
    -   Growing market
-   Urgent > People wants to use it. Quickly (People solving it right
    now)
    -   Lots of interested users
-   Expensive > Take a lot of money ($1B+ TAM)
    -   Can charge a lot of money
-   Mandatory > It cannot remain unsolved
    -   People will have to use a solution
-   Frequent* > People experience the problem often
    -   Give people lots of opportunities to convert

BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model:

B = M + A + T

-   B = Behavior (What you want to change)

-   M = Motivation (The problem need solving)

-   A = Ability (Your startup)

-   T = Trigger (What makes them realize “I want to solve the problem
    with your thing”)

The Ideal Problem

-   Lots of Users
-   Growing Market
-   Being solved right now
-   Costs a lot of money
-   Law has changed
-   Encountered hourly

2. Solution (what is the experiment being run)

-   Don’t start at the solution
-   Avoid Solution in Search of a Problem

3. Insight (why the thing being build is going to be successful)

What is your unfair advantage related to growth. You need one.

Types of Advantages:

-   Founders (Are you 1 of 10 people who can solve this problem)
-   Market (Is your market growing 20%+ a year)
-   Product (Is your product 10X better than anyone else’s)
-   Acquisition (Find acquisition path that cost no money
    i.e. word-of-mouth)
-   Monopoly (As your company grows, is it harder for you to be defeated
    by your competitors i.e. network effect)

Beliefs

1. Threshold Belief - What’s the default for them to succeed - “Can they
even build it?”

2. Miracle Belief - “If I beleive they can do this, they will be able to
take off.” - Success will be determined by how well you do sales,
convince customers, tell a story

Presenting Ideas to Investors

Just be clear. A clear idea is the foundation for growth. Make it clear,
legible, obvious.

Don’t sell investors. Investors sell themselves.

Building a Pitch Deck

Before anyone can remember, they have to understand.

Making things clear:

1. Make it legible

Legible slides are ones that people on the back row with bad eyesight
can read.

-   Lead with ‘what’. Not ‘why’. Not ‘how’
-   Be concise. Make the time investors spend on your idea efficient.
-   Legible slides can be understood by people who know nothing of your
    business.
-   Legible slides are one that democratize your idea.

2. Make it simple

3. Make it obvious

Presenting the Idea

Using “X for Y” comparison (things to consider):

-   Y should be a huge market
-   Is X a household name?
-   Does Y want X?

Be

-   Conversational
-   Jargon-free
-   Preamble-free
-   Reprodudcible

Avoid

-   Ambiguity
-   Complexity
-   Mystery (jargon, indefinite pronouns)
-   Ignorable (marketing speak, MBA speak, buzzwords)

Evaluating Investor Reactions:

-   Do they understand the idea?
-   Are they excited by it?
-   Do they like the team?
