Gestalt Principle

*** START OF NOTE ***

Introduction

The Gestalt Principle attempts to describe how people perceive visual
elements when certain conditions apply

-   Gestalt (German - form, shape): a group of visual perception
    principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s
-   Built on the theory that “an organized whole, is perceived as
    greater than the sum of its parts”

4 Key Ideas

Emergence

People tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form.
Our brain recognizes a simple, well-defined object quicker than a
detailed one.

Reification

People can recognize objects even when there are parts of them missing.
Our brain matches what we see with familiar patterns stored in our
memory and fills in the gaps.

Multi-Stability

People will often interpret ambiguous objects in more than one ways. Our
brains will bounce back and forth between the alternatives seeking
certainty. As a result, one view will become more dominant while the
other one will get harder to see.

Invariance

People can recognise simple objects independently of their rotation,
scale and translation. Our brain can perceive objects from different
perspectives, despite their different appearance.

Application to UI Design

Proximity

Elements arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than
those placed further apart. Different elements are viewed mainly as a
group rather than as individual elements.

Application

-   Grouping similar information
-   Organising content
-   Decluttering layouts

Note: White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow,
helping users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the
content.

Common Region

Elements placed within the same region are perceived as grouped

Application

-   boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information
-   achieve content separation or act as a focal point
-   hold together many different elements keeping them unified within
    larger groups

These can be achieved with the use of line, color, shape, and shadow.

Similarity

Elements sharing similar visual characteristics are perceived to be more
related than those not sharing similar characteristics.

Application

-   help with organizing and classifying objects within a group as well
    as linking them with a specific meaning or function.

Make things similar through color, size, shape, texture, dimension,
orientation.

An object can get emphasized by being different from the rest, called
‘Anomaly’. This can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can
draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point)
while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow.

Closure

A group of elements are often perceived to be a single recognizable form
or figure. The Closure also occurs when an object is incomplete, or
parts of it are not enclosed.

Application

When presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump
to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole.

we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate
information, reducing complexity. This helps minimize visual noise and
convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a relatively small space.

Symmetry

Symmetrical elements tend to perceived as belonging together regardless
of their distance, giving us a feeling of solidity and order.

Application

Symmetrical elements are simple, harmonious and visually pleasing

Useful tool for communicating information quickly and efficiently.

Symmetry feels comfortable helping us focus on what’s important.

Note: Symmetrical compositions are satisfying, but they can also get a
bit dull and static. Adding an asymmetrical element to an otherwise
symmetrical design can help with drawing attention while making an
impression.

Continuation

Elements arranged in a line or a soft curve are perceived to be more
related than those arranged randomly or in a harsh line.

Application

Continuity helps us interpret direction and movement through a
composition. It can help our eyes move smoothly through the page,
assisting with legibility.

Disruption of continuity can signal the end of a section drawing
attention to a new piece of content.

Common Fate

Elements moving towards the same direction are perceived as more related
than those moving in different directions, or not moving at all.

Application

Regardless of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they
might appear, if they are moving or changing together, they are
perceived as related

The Common Fate principle is more potent when elements move
synchronized.

It can help with grouping relevant information and linking actions with
results. The disruption of a synchronized movement can grab users’
attention and direct it to a specific element or feature. It can also,
establish relationships between different groups or states.
