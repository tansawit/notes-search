Introduction

  “We don’t want people to need to make choices about which data to
  keep” - Ant Rowstron (Principal Researcher and Deputy Lab Director,
  MSR)

In the past, you don’t often know the value of something. For example,
duplicate photos might have been previously discarded to save storage
space. Now however, those duplicates could have been used along with
modern processes to create higher-fidelity images. The aim is to make a
new storage medium that is cheap enough so that people can store all
their data. With this, if in the future the data does prove valuable, we
can exploit it without have to worry about whether you’ve lost it.

Research Goal

The project ai to build a new storage system designed for the cloud era
through researching techniques to write data and structures into pure
quartz glass. this is to produce a storage system that can sustain the
increasing demand for storage in the current era. It also tries to
produce a solution that is more persistent, one that could potentially
last for millions of years, not subjugated to bit rot, decay, as well as
one that is abuse-resistant.

Advantages

-   Extremely high data density
-   Very low cost
-   No bit rot/decay
-   ‘Abuse-resistant’ (pressure, temperature, scratching etc.)
-   New storage systems means we are not limited by previous form
    factors and can explore alternative shape/sizes for the glass nedium

Existing solutions

The majority of the current solutions for long-term cold storage depends
on either hard drive disk or tapes. Both of these have the benefits of
low cost, but it would require a prohibitive amount of them to satisfy
the current requirements. In addition, due to the low-persistent nature
of the medium, any sdata stored on them would need to be frequently
migrated.

Methodology

The procedure for producing such glass consists of firing femto-lasers
into the glass piece to generate nano-structures (voxels) which is then
used to encode the data. A single piece of glass can then contain
multiple layers of these structures, with the current maximum produced
sitting at around 75 layers.

Challenges

Current research on the project are looking into how we can drive the
density of the medium up further. While possible solutions includes
increasing the number of layers and reducing the space between the
nanostructures, both of these would introduce the problem of adding
noise to the data, complicating the readout process.
