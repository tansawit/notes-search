Elasticsearch

*** START OF NOTE ***

Elasticsearch is a distributed, JSON-based, and RESTful search and
analytics engine.

Notes

Query and Analysis

It allows you to perform and combine many types of searches (structured,
unstructured, geo, metric) any way you want. Its aggregation feature
also allows you to explore trends and pattern in your data.

Implementation

Elasticsearch is implemented using

-   inverted indices with finite state transducers for full-text
    querying
-   BKD trees for storing numeric/geo data
-   column store for analytics

Scalability

Elasticseh can be set to run anywhere from laptops to large servers. The
user talk to an instance running on a single node the same way they
would with a large node-cluster. It scales horizontally and
automatically manage how indices and queries are distributed across the
cluster for smooth operations.

Relevance

Search results can be set based on a variety of factors (term frequency,
recency, popularity, etc.). It can also handle ‘human errors’ such as
typos.

Resiliency

Elasticsearch detects failures to keep data and cluster safe and
available. Cross-cluster replication means a second cluster can be used
as a hot backup.
