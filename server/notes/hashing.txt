Hash Functions

Input: Arbitrary-Length Data

Output: Fixed-size digest (n bits)

Properties

-   No keys
-   Fixed Function

Examples: SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-3

Characteristics of a Good Hash Function

Collision Resistance

-   Hard to find pair of input x, x′ such that H(x) = H(x’)

Preimage Resistance

-   Given y, hard to find x′ such that H(x′) = y

Second Preimage Resistance

-   Given x, hard to find an x′ such that H(x) = H(x′)

SHA-256

Basics

Input: Arbitrary Length Data

Output: 256-bit digest

Built with “compression function” h using Merkle–Damgård construction

Algorithm

1.  Pad input into multiple of 512 bits using a fixed algorithm
2.  Split into 512-bit blocks
3.   = constant initialization vector,
4.  Return

Other Hash Functions

MD5

-   Once ubiquitous
-   Broken in 2004
-   Now easy to find collisions

SHA-1

-   Fairly widely used
-   Started to be unsupported in HTTPS in January 2016
