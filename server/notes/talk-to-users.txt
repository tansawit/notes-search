How to Talk to Users
 
*** START OF NOTE ***

Customers don’t buy the what. They buy the why - (Eric Migicovsky)

Notes from Eric Migicovsky’s talk as part of Y Combinator’s Startup
School 2019 Series.

Original Video: here. ## General

A good founder must maintain a direct connection to their users
throughout the lifespan of the company in order to extract information
from users.

Users in general are not good at identifying the next feature they want.

Two things you must do to start a company:

-   Code or build your product
-   Talk to users

User Interviews

The goal of the user interview is to extract information that will help
improve your product/positioning/marketing

Lessons from the book The Mom Test:

-   Talk about their life, not your ideas
-   Talk about specifics, not hypotheticals
    -   Don’t talk about could be’s, or ‘if we build this feature’
    -   Talk about specifics that have already occured in the user’s
        life
    -   Talk in general about the user’s life, not just your specific
        product
-   Listen. Don’t talk

Five questions to ask users:

-   What is the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
-   Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem
    -   Extracts context
-   Why was it hard?
    -   What were the specific things that they encountered?
-   What, if anything, have they done to solve this problem?
    -   If they haven’t explored solution, the problem might not be
        burning enough for them to be interested in your product
    -   Opportunity to learn about your competitors
-   What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve already tried?

Note: Never ask users for features. It’s not their job. It’s yours.
Their job is to give you problems.

Three phases to conduct user interviews

1. Idea Phase (find users with the problem)

-   Opportunities
    -   Friends, co-workers, introductions
    -   Drop by in person
        -   Feeling of intrusion - If you truly think that you’re
            solving a problem, you’ll actually be helping them out by
            taking their time.
    -   Industry events
-   Tips
    -   Take notes
    -   Keep it casual
    -   Be careful with their time

2. Prototype Phase (find the best first customers)

-   Find the answers to
    -   How much does this problem cost them?
        -   Revenue you stand to earn. The expense your customers are
            currently spending to solve the problem.
    -   How frequent is the problem?
        -   The best problems are ones that are encountered frequently.
            The users experiencing this feels the pain, and thus are
            receptive to potential solutions
    -   How large is their budget?
        -   Whether they have the ability to solve the problem, given
            the choice

Ideal intersection for first customers
3. After-launch Phase (find product market fit)

-   Tips
    -   Ask users for phone number for potential followup questions
    -   Don’t design by committee
        -   Can’t ask users what features they want
        -   Instead you need to understand whether the features will
            truly make the product sticky/useful
        -   Ask for credit card to gauge ‘real interest’
    -   Discard bad data
        -   Compliments - feels good, but not useful
            -   Not specific
            -   Not tactical
        -   Fluff/Hypotheticals
            -   User interviews are not for pitching your
                ideas/features, they are for learning about your users’
                problems
