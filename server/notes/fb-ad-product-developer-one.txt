-   Event code: Only install on specific pages where you want to measure
    actions or events important to business goals
    -   For example , add the Add to Cart event code on the page where

Data Sent

Personally Identifiable Information (PII), if any, is sent and received
using data hashing, matched with anonymized Facebook data, then securely
deleted.

-   HTTP headers: IP address, browser info, page location, document,
    referrer, and device
-   Pixel data: pixel ID and Facebook cookie
-   Button-click data: buttons clicked by visitors and the labels, page
    visited due to the click, form-field names (form-field values need
    to be included as part of advanced matching/optional values)
-   Page metadata: Page description, tags, keywords

How Facebook Match People

A combination of computer, browser, and login data results in a hash
that’s stored on the Facebook side, which is associated with a person’s
unique Facebook ID.

When someone logs into Facebook in a browser:

-   Facebook records the hash
-   When your webpage is visited, Facebook servers receive the pixel
    call from your site
-   Facebook records that visit with the hash of who visited
-   Facebook can then match signature with a Facebook ID
-   Facebook drop the visit record after the matching process

One Facebook ID can have multiple hashes associated. A person can match
to multiple computers and browsers as long as they have logged into
Facebook

Events

PageView event is part of the Pixel base code and is fired on every
page. This event allows you to create rules and audiences, and optimizes
towards those who visited a certain page from your site using URL rules
as filters.

You can use a set of standard events to let Facebook know how far along
in the funnel the current visitor reached.
